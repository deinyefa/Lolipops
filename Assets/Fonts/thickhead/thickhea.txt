Readme for Thickhead fonts:This archive contains the T1, and TT versions of Thickhead.What can I say. This font is really round.There are some similar looking fonts floating around, which proves how little creativity it takes to open Helvetica in Fontographer, select all, and hit command-8. Okay, there might be a little more to this font than that. BTW, fonts in the 60's and 70's did not look like this. You can even check.All fonts are free.s.ulrich/incinerator.  scott8933@aol.comApril 21, 1997
